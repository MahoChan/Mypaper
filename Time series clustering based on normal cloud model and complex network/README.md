# Time series clustering based on normal cloud model and complex network

Abstract
When data mining research is conducted, it is diï¬€icult to obtain precise domain knowledge to set a similarity threshold. What is more, noise and missing values are inevitable. Missing values and noise without pre-processing are a challenge for many algorithms. A time series clustering method is proposed based on the normal cloud model and complex network. The five stages of the proposed clustering algorithm are the matrix profile similarity measurement, construction of normal cloud model and filtering, cloud model expectation curve weighting, degree centrality reweighting, and community discovery in the complex networks. Local features are also considered, and the effects of missing values are reduced when performing similarity measurements. The normal cloud model can be used to set thresholds adaptively. The Louvain algorithm accomplishes the clustering task in complex networks without specifying the clusters in advance. Experiments are conducted on 94 datasets and compared with 8 clustering methods in the UCR time-series clustering benchmark study. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can perform well on many datasets.
